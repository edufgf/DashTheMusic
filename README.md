Dash The Music
============

Music dash game concept. Using Allegro 5 and C++

I got bored while in school break and decided to make a game related to music.
This was an attempt to recreate what is going on my imagination while listening to music.

You control the ball height with the mouse. Obstacles are fixed according to the used song.
I was trying to create a program to place all obstacles positions based on a gameplay with no obstacles. Unfortunately unfinished.

This is the result of 4 days of coding from scratch and learning Allegro 5.<br>
